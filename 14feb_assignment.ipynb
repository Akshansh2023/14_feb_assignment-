    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handel thrads in pyhton.\n",

    "# Answer\n",
    "\n",
    ". Multithreading in Python is a popular technique that enables multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously. In simple words, the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading. . Multithreading in Python should be used only when there is no existing inter-dependency between the threads. . Threading Module used to handel thrads in pyhton.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module is the high-level implementation of multithreading in Python. It is the go-to approach for managing multithreaded applications. The benefits of the Threading module outweigh the ones of the Thread module.\n",

    "# Answer\n",
    "\n",
    ". run() − The run() method is the entry point for a thread. . start() − The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method. . join() − The join() waits for threads to terminate. . isAlive() − The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.\n",

    ". If you have a system with multiple CPUs or cores, then you can have all CPUs executing application code all at the same time. . If the process needs to block for some reason (disk I/O, user input, network I/O) then while a thread or threads are blocked waiting for I/O completion other thread(s) can be doing other work.\n",
